If AF 0.2% implies a carrier rate that seems too high for a fully penetrant AR disorder, BS1 may be appropriate—especially if no affected homozygotes are seen in large datasets. Ensure population matching and data quality before applying."}

Parents reportedly unaffected.\nDe novo testing: only one parent tested; the other unavailable.\nPhenotype: highly consistent with gene.\nPaternity/maternity: not confirmed.","output":"Use PS2 only when de novo status is confirmed with appropriate parental testing (and ideally maternity/paternity confirmation depending on lab policy).\nWith incomplete parental testing, apply PM6 (assumed de novo) rather than PS2.\nIf phenotype is highly specific, PP4 may also support pathogenicity, but do not upgrade PM6 to PS2 without confirmation."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Determine PVS1 strength for a stop-gain variant.","input":"Gene: haploinsufficient disease mechanism established.\nVariant: early stop-gain in exon 2 of 20.\nPredicted NMD: yes.\nAlternative transcripts: none clinically relevant.\nKnown LoF variants: numerous pathogenic reported.","output":"PVS1 (Very Strong) is appropriate because the variant is predicted to undergo NMD, leading to loss of function in a gene where LoF is a known mechanism.\nCheckpoints: confirm transcript selection, exon location relative to NMD rules, and rule out rescue by alternative transcripts. If all support LoF, keep PVS1 at Very Strong."}

Determine PVS1 strength for a stop-gain variant.","input":"Gene: LoF is a known mechanism.\nVariant: stop-gain in last exon.\nPredicted NMD: no.\nProtein impact: truncates last 25 amino acids.\nCritical domain: unknown.","output":"PVS1 should be downgraded (e.g., PVS1_Moderate or PVS1_Supporting) when NMD is not expected and the truncation may have limited functional impact.\nStrength depends on whether the truncated region is critical and whether similar C-terminal truncations are known pathogenic. Without such evidence, do not assign PVS1 Very Strong."}

Assess whether PM2 can be applied and at what strength.","input":"Variant: missense\ngnomAD: absent\nCoverage in gnomAD at locus: good\nDisease: AD, rare\nPopulation match: patient ancestry well represented","output":"PM2_supporting is appropriate when the variant is absent (or extremely rare) in large population databases with adequate coverage, and rarity is consistent with the disease.\nDo not use PM2 as strong evidence alone; keep at supporting (or moderate in older frameworks) depending on your lab policy and gene/disease context."}

Interpret PP1 strength for segregation.","input":"AD disorder, high penetrance.\nVariant segregates with disease in 5 informative meioses.\nPhenotype in family: consistent.\nNo phenocopies known.","output":"PP1 strength depends on the number of informative segregations and quality of phenotype assignment.\nWith multiple informative meioses (e.g., 5) in a high-penetrance AD disorder and consistent phenotype, PP1_Strong may be appropriate.\nLimitations: confirm diagnoses, consider age-related penetrance, exclude phenocopies, and ensure the variant is the likely causal allele."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret splice-region variant without RNA studies.","input":"Variant: intronic +5 position\nSpliceAI: high\nOther predictors: mixed\ngnomAD: very rare\nNo RNA\nPhenotype: consistent","output":"Without RNA studies, splice predictions alone are insufficient for strong pathogenic evidence.\nYou may consider PP3 (supporting) if multiple validated splicing predictors agree, but avoid PS3.\nSeek additional evidence: segregation, de novo status, consistent phenotype, and ideally RNA (patient tissue or minigene). If evidence remains limited, classify as VUS."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Determine if PS3 (functional evidence) can be applied.","input":"Functional study: in vitro assay in overexpression system\nShows reduced protein activity\nNo positive/negative controls described\nNot replicated\nUnclear relevance to disease mechanism","output":"Do not apply PS3 as strong evidence unless the assay is well-validated, reproducible, and reflects the disease mechanism.\nIn this scenario, the study quality is insufficient; at most, consider weak/supporting evidence (or none), and prioritize validated assays with appropriate controls and replication."}

Interpret LOEUF/pLI in variant assessment.","input":"Gene LOEUF: very low (strong LoF constraint)\nVariant: predicted LoF\nPhenotype: consistent with gene-disease association","output":"Strong LoF constraint (low LOEUF / high pLI) supports the plausibility that LoF variants are deleterious in this gene, but it is not an ACMG criterion by itself.\nIt can provide gene-level context that strengthens confidence when applying PVS1 and interpreting phenotype match, while still requiring variant-level evidence (de novo, segregation, rarity, etc.)."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Evaluate whether PM1 (hotspot/domain) applies for a missense variant.","input":"Variant: missense in a well-established critical domain\nMultiple known pathogenic missense cluster in this domain\nNo benign missense reported in domain\ngnomAD: absent","output":"PM1 can apply when the variant lies in a mutational hotspot or critical functional domain with known pathogenic enrichment and few/no benign variants.\nIf the domain is well-established as critical and shows pathogenic clustering, PM1 (moderate) may be appropriate. Confirm domain annotation and exclude regions prone to artefacts."}

Interpret a variant found by tumor sequencing for possible germline reporting.","input":"Variant detected at ~50% VAF in tumor-only sequencing\nNo matched normal\nGene: hereditary cancer gene\nTumor purity: unknown\nVariant known pathogenic in germline context","output":"Tumor-only VAF around 50% can be consistent with germline, but also with somatic events depending on copy number, purity, and LOH.\nClinical reporting should label germline status as unconfirmed and recommend confirmatory germline testing from non-tumor tissue.\nConsider tumor context (CNAs/LOH), variant type, and patient/family history to prioritize follow-up."}
{"instruction":"Explain the concept to a clinician in simple terms.","input":"Concept: Penetrance\nRequirements:\n1) Simple definition\n2) One clinical example","output":"Penetrance is the chance that someone who carries a disease-causing variant will actually show symptoms.\nExample: If a variant has 80% penetrance, about 8 in 10 carriers develop the condition, while some carriers remain unaffected."}
{"instruction":"Explain the concept to a clinician in simple terms.","input":"Concept: Variable expressivity\nRequirements:\n1) Simple definition\n2) One clinical example","output":"Variable expressivity means people with the same pathogenic variant can have different severity or different symptoms.\nExample: Two relatives with the same variant may both have the condition, but one has mild features while the other has more severe complications."}
{"instruction":"Explain the concept to a clinician in simple terms.","input":"Concept: De novo variant\nRequirements:\n1) Simple definition\n2) One clinical example","output":"A de novo variant is a genetic change that is present in the child but not detected in either parent.\nExample: A child with a classic syndrome and a confirmed de novo pathogenic variant in a relevant gene, while both parents test negative."}
{"instruction":"Explain the concept to a clinician in simple terms.","input":"Concept: Haploinsufficiency\nRequirements:\n1) Simple definition\n2) One clinical example","output":"Haploinsufficiency means having only one working copy of a gene is not enough for normal function, so losing one copy causes disease.\nExample: A deletion or nonsense variant that removes one functional copy of a haploinsufficient gene leading to a dominant disorder."}
{"instruction":"Explain the concept to a clinician in simple terms.","input":"Concept: Gain-of-function\nRequirements:\n1) Simple definition\n2) One clinical example","output":"Gain-of-function means a variant causes the protein to become overactive or behave in a new harmful way.\nExample: A missense variant that increases signaling activity in a pathway gene and causes a dominant phenotype."}
{"instruction":"Explain to a clinician how BA1 differs from BS1 in practice.","input":"Disease: rare AD\nQuestion: BA1 vs BS1 usage","output":"BA1 is used when the allele frequency is so high that pathogenicity is essentially incompatible with the disease (stand-alone benign). BS1 is used when frequency is higher than expected but not high enough for BA1 (strong benign). Both require correct population matching, disease prevalence/penetrance considerations, and good quality population data."}

Consider PM1 if variant is in a critical domain/hotspot.\nCaveats: Without functional or case enrichment evidence, classification may remain Likely Pathogenic rather than Pathogenic."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Evaluate whether BP7 can be applied.","input":"Variant: synonymous\nSplice predictors: no impact\nConservation: low\nNo other evidence","output":"BP7 (supporting benign) can apply for a synonymous variant when splicing impact is unlikely and the nucleotide is not highly conserved.\nEnsure splicing predictions and transcript context are appropriate. If consistent, BP7 supports benign interpretation."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Evaluate whether BP4 can be applied.","input":"Missense variant\nIn-silico predictors mostly benign\nNo functional data\nRare in gnomAD","output":"BP4 (supporting benign) may be applied when multiple well-validated in-silico tools agree on no impact.\nHowever, if the variant is extremely rare and phenotype fits, BP4 alone should not drive classification; weigh all evidence and consider VUS if conflicting."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret a CNV with gene dosage sensitivity context.","input":"CNV: 1.2 Mb deletion including a known haploinsufficient gene\nPhenotype: consistent with gene-associated syndrome\nInheritance: de novo","output":"A de novo deletion affecting a known haploinsufficient gene supports pathogenicity. Key points: confirm boundaries and gene content, evaluate established haploinsufficiency evidence, and ensure phenotype match. De novo status strengthens the interpretation; classification is typically Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic depending on CNV classification standards."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret a duplication with uncertain triplosensitivity.","input":"CNV: duplication including a gene without established triplosensitivity\nPhenotype: non-specific\nInheritance: inherited from unaffected parent","output":"Without established triplosensitivity and with inheritance from an unaffected parent plus non-specific phenotype, the duplication is less likely to be pathogenic.\nIt may be classified as VUS or Likely Benign depending on CNV guidelines and size/gene content. Consider penetrance, variable expressivity, and additional evidence."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. QC question: variants in segmental duplications.","input":"Variant called in a segmentally duplicated region\nRead mapping quality: low\nAlternate alleles seen across multiple loci\nQuestion: what to do before interpretation?","output":"Do not interpret clinically until technical validity is established. Use orthogonal validation (e.g., Sanger/long-read), inspect read alignments, confirm unique mapping, and consider specialized callers. Segmental duplications have high false-positive risk."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. QC question: low complexity region variant.","input":"Variant in a low-complexity repeat\nCaller flags: low confidence\nQuestion: how to validate?","output":"Low complexity regions are prone to artefacts. Review alignment, check strand bias and base qualities, confirm with orthogonal methods (Sanger/targeted PCR), and consider whether the locus is reliably callable in your assay before interpretation."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide if PM3 applies for a recessive disorder.","input":"AR disorder\nVariant A: known pathogenic\nVariant B: VUS\nPhase: unknown\nParents available","output":"PM3 requires evidence that the two variants are in trans in a recessive disorder (or other appropriate evidence of biallelic impact).\nFirst, determine phase via parental testing. If in trans, PM3 can support pathogenicity of the VUS (strength depends on additional observations/case counts). Without phase, avoid PM3."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Reclassification scenario.","input":"Variant currently VUS\nNow observed in multiple unrelated affected individuals with consistent phenotype\nDe novo reported in 2 cases\nAbsent from population databases\nQuestion: what evidence supports reclassification?","output":"Evidence supporting upgrade includes PS4 (case enrichment), PS2 (confirmed de novo in multiple cases), PM2_supporting (rarity), and PP4 (phenotype specificity). Strength depends on case counts, quality of phenotyping, and exclusion of alternative causes. Combine criteria per ACMG to consider Likely Pathogenic/Pathogenic reclassification."}
{"instruction":"Explain transcript selection impact for clinicians.","input":"Topic: MANE Select vs tissue-specific isoforms\nQuestion: why it matters for coding variant interpretation?","output":"Transcript choice affects variant nomenclature and whether a change is truly coding/functional in the relevant isoform. MANE Select provides a stable, widely used reference, but some diseases involve tissue-specific transcripts. Using the wrong transcript can misclassify a variant’s consequence (e.g., missense vs non-coding), so transcript selection should align with clinical context and expression evidence."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret mosaic variant evidence.","input":"Dominant disorder with high de novo rate\nVariant detected at 12% VAF in blood\nPhenotype: consistent\nParental testing: negative\nQuestion: key criteria and caveats?","output":"A low VAF suggests mosaicism; interpretation depends on assay sensitivity, tissue distribution, and phenotype fit. De novo evidence may still apply but must consider detection limits in parents and the possibility of parental mosaicism. Recommend confirmatory testing (another tissue, deeper sequencing) and cautious counseling regarding recurrence risk."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide if BA1 should not be applied due to founder effect concerns.","input":"Variant AF: 0.01 in one subpopulation only\nDisease: founder-associated in that ancestry\nPenetrance: reduced\nCases reported in same ancestry","output":"Do not automatically apply BA1 if the elevated frequency may reflect a founder pathogenic variant with reduced penetrance or late onset. Evaluate disease prevalence in that ancestry, penetrance, phenotype spectrum, and whether the variant is established as pathogenic founder. Use ancestry-matched controls and clinical evidence before applying benign frequency criteria."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question for clinicians.","input":"Question: What is the difference between penetrance and expressivity?","output":"Penetrance is whether a carrier shows the phenotype at all (yes/no probability). Expressivity is how severe or what features the phenotype includes among those who are affected. A variant can have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity at the same time."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question for clinicians.","input":"Question: How does reduced penetrance affect counseling in autosomal-dominant disease?","output":"Reduced penetrance means some carriers remain unaffected, so a negative family history doesn’t exclude a pathogenic variant. Counseling should address uncertainty in predicting who will develop symptoms, the need for surveillance when appropriate, and careful interpretation of segregation in families."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is a founder mutation and how can it be established?","output":"A founder mutation arises in a common ancestor and becomes frequent in a population. Evidence includes: higher frequency in a specific ancestry, shared haplotype around the variant among unrelated carriers, consistent geographic/ethnic clustering, and historical/epidemiologic support. It should not be assumed from frequency alone."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is the difference between germline and somatic variants?","output":"Germline variants are present in essentially all cells and can be inherited. Somatic variants arise in a subset of cells (e.g., tumors) and are not usually inherited. Tumor-only sequencing can’t always distinguish them without matched normal testing."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: A variant is absent in gnomAD. Can we assume it is pathogenic?","output":"No. Absence from population databases only supports rarity (PM2_supporting) and does not prove pathogenicity. Many rare variants are benign. You still need gene/disease mechanism, phenotype fit, segregation/de novo evidence, functional data, and/or case enrichment."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: When should a variant be confirmed by Sanger before clinical reporting?","output":"Confirmation is recommended when variant quality is borderline, the locus is technically challenging (repeats, segmental duplications), allele balance is atypical, mosaicism is suspected, or the method’s validation requires orthogonal confirmation. High-confidence calls in well-behaved regions may not always require Sanger depending on lab policy."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: How do you validate a suspected splice variant if RNA is not available?","output":"Options include minigene assays, testing RNA from alternative tissues (when expression allows), using multiple splicing predictors cautiously, reviewing published cases, and evaluating segregation/case evidence. Ultimately, functional confirmation is preferred before using strong functional ACMG criteria."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Classify with emphasis on benign evidence.","input":"Variant: missense\ngnomAD AF: 0.02 (across multiple ancestries)\nDisease: severe early-onset AD (~1/100,000)\nNo disease cases reported\nIn-silico: mixed","output":"Classification: Benign (or Likely Benign) depending on frequency thresholds.\nA frequency of 2% is far above what is compatible with a severe ultra-rare early-onset AD disorder, supporting BA1 or BS1 as strong benign evidence (after confirming ancestry consistency and data quality).\nIn-silico predictions are not needed to override strong frequency evidence."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret a variant with strong phenotype specificity.","input":"Gene-disease association: well-established\nPhenotype: highly specific\nVariant: rare missense\nNo functional data\nNo de novo info","output":"Phenotype specificity supports PP4, and rarity supports PM2_supporting. Without additional strong evidence (de novo/segregation/functional/case enrichment), classification often remains VUS or at best Likely Pathogenic in select contexts. Seek additional evidence rather than over-classifying."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is allelic heterogeneity and why does it matter for interpreting population frequency?","output":"Allelic heterogeneity means many different variants in the same gene can cause the same disease. It matters because even if a disease is rare, any one pathogenic variant might be extremely rare; population frequency thresholds for BA1/BS1 must account for how many different pathogenic alleles exist and how common each could be."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is genetic heterogeneity and why does it matter for ACMG interpretation?","output":"Genetic heterogeneity means different genes can cause similar phenotypes. It matters because phenotype match (PP4) is stronger when the phenotype is highly specific to one gene, and weaker when many genes can cause similar presentations."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide whether PP4 is appropriate.","input":"Phenotype: very specific classic syndrome strongly linked to one gene\nVariant: rare\nQuestion: can PP4 be applied?","output":"PP4 can be applied when the patient’s phenotype (and/or biochemical signature) is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology or limited differential.\nEnsure phenotyping is robust and alternative diagnoses are reasonably excluded."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide whether PS4 can be used.","input":"Variant seen in 8 unrelated affected individuals in multiple publications\nControls: absent or extremely rare in population databases\nPhenotype: consistent\nAscertainment: mixed\nQuestion: PS4 applicability?","output":"PS4 depends on statistically increased prevalence in affected individuals versus controls. Multiple unrelated cases with consistent phenotype support PS4, but strength depends on case-control rigor, potential ascertainment bias, and appropriate control frequency. If robust enrichment is demonstrated, PS4 may be applied (strength per evidence level); otherwise use weaker case-based support."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Handle a missense in a gene where disease is primarily LoF.","input":"Gene mechanism: haploinsufficiency (LoF)\nVariant: missense\nNo functional data\nPhenotype: consistent","output":"In a primarily LoF-driven disease, a missense variant requires additional evidence to be considered pathogenic (e.g., functional studies showing LoF effect, hotspot/domain enrichment, de novo/segregation). Do not assume pathogenicity based on gene association alone; classification may remain VUS without supporting data."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Assess whether BP2 applies.","input":"Scenario: Variant observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for an AD disorder\nGene: AD disease mechanism\nQuestion: BP2?","output":"BP2 (supporting benign) can apply when a variant is observed in trans with a pathogenic variant in a dominant disorder, suggesting the variant itself is not causing disease in that context. Ensure correct phasing and that the clinical phenotype is explained by the known pathogenic variant."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is the difference between a VUS and Likely Pathogenic?","output":"A VUS means there isn’t enough evidence to say pathogenic or benign, so it should not guide major clinical decisions alone. Likely Pathogenic means the balance of evidence supports disease causality, though some uncertainty remains; it may be used for management in appropriate clinical context per lab guidelines."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: Why can a variant be pathogenic in one disease context but not another?","output":"Variant interpretation is disease-specific. Frequency thresholds, penetrance assumptions, gene mechanism, and phenotype specificity differ by condition. The same variant might be too common to cause a severe early-onset disorder, yet still be relevant for a milder or late-onset trait under different assumptions."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: How do coverage and call quality in gnomAD affect PM2/BA1/BS1 decisions?","output":"If coverage is poor or the site is hard to call, absence from gnomAD is less informative and PM2 should be used cautiously. For frequency-based benign criteria, ensure the frequency estimate is reliable (adequate coverage, consistent calling) and consider subpopulation artifacts."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret a splice acceptor variant.","input":"Variant: canonical splice acceptor (-1 or -2)\nGene: LoF known mechanism\ngnomAD: absent\nPhenotype: consistent","output":"Canonical splice-site variants in a LoF disease gene often meet PVS1 (strength per predicted impact/NMD and transcript context), plus PM2_supporting for rarity, and PP4 for phenotype specificity. Final classification depends on whether splicing is expected to cause LoF and whether any contradictory benign evidence exists."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide if PM5 applies.","input":"Missense variant at residue where a different missense change is established pathogenic\nSame amino acid position\nSimilar phenotype","output":"PM5 can apply when a novel missense change occurs at an amino acid residue where a different missense change has been established as pathogenic. Confirm the known pathogenic variant’s evidence quality and that the residue is truly critical; PM5 strength is typically moderate."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Evaluate whether BS2 applies.","input":"Variant observed in multiple healthy adults with no signs of the disease\nDisease: fully penetrant, early-onset\nVariant type: LoF in relevant gene","output":"BS2 can apply when the variant is observed in healthy individuals who should express the phenotype if the variant were pathogenic (considering age, penetrance, and expressivity). For a fully penetrant early-onset disease, multiple unaffected adult carriers is strong evidence against pathogenicity, assuming phenotype assessment is reliable."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Evaluate whether PP3 applies.","input":"Splice variant outside canonical positions\nMultiple splicing predictors agree on aberrant splicing\nNo RNA\nVariant rare","output":"PP3 (supporting pathogenic) can be applied when multiple validated computational tools support a deleterious effect on splicing. Without RNA, do not use PS3. Treat PP3 as supporting and combine with other evidence (rarity, phenotype, segregation) for classification."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is compound heterozygosity?","output":"Compound heterozygosity means a person has two different variants in the same gene, one on each allele (in trans). In a recessive disease, two pathogenic variants in trans can cause the disorder."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: Why is phase (cis/trans) important in recessive variant interpretation?","output":"Because two variants in cis (same chromosome) still leave the other allele intact and may not cause a recessive disease, whereas variants in trans affect both alleles and can be causative. Phase determines whether criteria like PM3 apply."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is the clinical impact of variable penetrance for cascade testing?","output":"Variable penetrance means some relatives may carry the pathogenic variant but never develop symptoms. Cascade testing remains useful, but counseling must explain that a positive result indicates increased risk, not certainty, and management decisions should reflect penetrance and age-related risk."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: A variant is in a gene with high pLI/low LOEUF but the phenotype doesn't match. How should that affect interpretation?","output":"Constraint supports that LoF may be deleterious, but phenotype mismatch weakens the case for clinical pathogenicity in the tested indication. Interpretation remains disease- and phenotype-specific; without a plausible gene-disease fit, avoid over-calling and consider VUS or incidental finding frameworks if relevant."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret evidence when parental mosaicism is suspected.","input":"Child has variant; parent negative on standard testing.\nVariant seen at low level in parent on deep sequencing.\nDisease: AD with high de novo rate","output":"Low-level parental mosaicism supports transmission risk and can still support de novo-related reasoning in the child, but PS2 criteria should be applied carefully because the variant is not truly de novo. Counseling should address increased recurrence risk compared with a true de novo event, and labs should document detection limits and mosaic fraction."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide whether BS3 can be applied.","input":"Functional study in patient-derived cells\nAssay validated with controls\nShows normal protein function/splicing\nReplicated","output":"BS3 (strong benign) can be applied when well-established functional studies show no damaging effect. Ensure the assay is appropriate for the disease mechanism, includes controls, and is reproducible. Combine BS3 with other evidence (e.g., population frequency) for final classification."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Address ascertainment bias in case evidence.","input":"Variant reported in several affected individuals, but all from a single clinic and publication.\nNo controls provided.\ngnomAD rare.","output":"Case reports support pathogenicity but may be subject to ascertainment bias. Without proper controls or statistical enrichment, do not over-apply PS4. Treat as weaker evidence (supporting) unless multiple independent cohorts and rigorous enrichment are shown."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What does “constraint” (pLI/LOEUF) actually measure?","output":"Constraint metrics estimate how depleted a gene is for certain classes of variation (like LoF) in the general population compared with expectation. Strong depletion suggests LoF variants are selected against, implying they may be deleterious, but it does not directly prove disease causality for a specific variant."}
{"instruction":"General genetics question.","input":"Question: What is the difference between pathogenicity and clinical actionability?","output":"Pathogenicity is whether a variant causes disease. Actionability is whether knowing it changes medical management (screening, prevention, treatment). A pathogenic variant in a gene with no established management recommendations may be less actionable clinically, though still important for diagnosis and counseling."}
{"instruction":"Bioinformatics/QC question.","input":"Question: How can segmental duplications create false-positive SNVs/indels?","output":"Reads from multiple similar genomic regions can mis-map to one location, creating apparent variants. This often shows up as low mapping quality, multiple mismatches, and inconsistent allele patterns. Visual inspection and orthogonal validation are essential before interpretation."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Interpret a scenario with strong benign evidence but phenotype match.","input":"Variant frequency: 1% in ancestry-matched controls\nDisease: ultra-rare severe early-onset\nPhenotype: matches well\nVariant type: missense","output":"Even with phenotype match, a 1% frequency is typically incompatible with an ultra-rare severe early-onset disorder, supporting strong benign evidence (BA1/BS1). Reassess diagnosis, consider phenocopies, and consider whether the phenotype is genetically heterogeneous. Avoid classifying as pathogenic when frequency strongly contradicts."}
{"instruction":"You are a clinical geneticist. Decide classification when only PP4 and PM2_supporting are present.","input":"Phenotype highly specific\nVariant absent from gnomAD\nNo segregation/de novo\nNo functional data\nNo case enrichment","output":"Classification: VUS (or at most leaning toward Likely Pathogenic in rare special contexts, but typically VUS).\nPP4 + PM2_supporting alone is usually insufficient for Likely Pathogenic because neither is strong evidence. Seek additional evidence (de novo, segregation, functional data, multiple unrelated cases)."}
